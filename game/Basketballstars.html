</style> <div id="gamedesc" ><wgDev>Baseball Stars is hands-down the best baseball game online you can play for free. This game is ad-free and of course free here at Retro 621.net - you play with local mulitplayer againist ai which is some are very hard and other are not so hard.  Basketball Stars simulates two kinds of competitions: a shooting race and a one-on-one game. Games cost in-game currency or real money to enter (against a real, online opponent), and then the winner gets the prize money with which you can buy stuff like shirts, hats, sunglasses, headphones</div>
